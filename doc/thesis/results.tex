\section{Bus covariance}

\section{Line covariance}

By incorporating bus covariances in our model (which result from correlated weather), we hope to find new structure in the line covariances. 
To assess the effect of estimating bus covariances, we compare three possible bus covariance matrices:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{The identity matrix}: all bus injections are independently Gaussian distributed with the same variance. (They are almost IID, but their means differ.)
	\item \emph{The diagonal of estimated variances}: all bus injections are independently Gaussian distributed, but their variances and means differ.
	\item \emph{The estimated covariances}: the vector of bus injections is (multivariate) Gaussian distributed. All bus injections are, in general, dependent on each other, and their variances and means differ.
\end{enumerate}

We expect the covariance of a random pair of lines to be relatively low, when their physical separation (measured either in kilometres or in graph distance) is high. 
Because weather is correlated, even at high distance, using the bus full covariance might result in higher covariances between lines with high separation. (This was concluded by \cite{Nesti2018emergentfailures}.) 

Using a different bus covariance matrix will likely result in a overall increase or decrease of line covariances. Note, however, that the line covariance matrix is scaled by an arbitrary factor $\epsilon$, so any overall change in covariance has no significance in the model. \todo{Maar als je normaliseert op variantie?}
