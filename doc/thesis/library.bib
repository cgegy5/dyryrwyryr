abstract = {Line outage distribution factors (LODFs) are utilized to perform contingency analyses in power systems. Since each contingency requires separate LODFs, a quick calculation of LODFs, especially with multiple-line outages, could speed up contingency analyses and improve significantly the security analyses of power systems. This letter provides two direct proofs for expressing LODFs in terms of power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs) of pre-contingency network. Simple matrix calculations are required in the proposed approach for a fast evaluation of LODFs. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Linear active-power-only DC power flow approximations are pervasive in the planning and control of power systems. However, these approximations fail to capture reactive power and voltage magnitudes, both of which are necessary in many applications to ensure voltage stability and AC power flow feasibility. This paper proposes linear-programming models (the LPAC models) that incorporate reactive power and voltage magnitudes in a linear power flow approximation. The LPAC models are built on a convex approximation of the cosine terms in the AC equations, as well as Taylor approximations of the remaining nonlinear terms. Experimental comparisons with AC solutions on a variety of standard IEEE and MatPower benchmarks show that the LPAC models produce accurate values for active and reactive power, phase angles, and voltage magnitudes. The potential benefits of the LPAC models are illustrated on two "proof-of-concept" studies in power restoration and capacitor placement.},

@techreport{Denholm2015,
abstract = {In 2013, the California Independent System Operator published the “duck chart,” which shows a significant drop in mid-day net load on a spring day as solar photovoltaics (PV) are added to the system. The chart raises concerns that the conventional power system will be unable to accommodate the ramp rate and range needed to fully utilize solar energy, particularly on days characterized by the duck shape. This could result in “overgeneration” and curtailed renewable energy, increasing its costs and reducing its environmental benefits. This paper explores the duck chart in detail, examining how much PV might need to be curtailed if additional grid flexibility measures are not taken, and how curtailment rates can be decreased by changing grid operational practices. It finds that under business-as-usual types of assumptions and corresponding levels of grid flexibility in California, solar penetrations as low as 20{\%} of annual energy could lead to marginal curtailment rates that exceed 30{\%}. However, by allowing (or requiring) distributed PV and storage (including new installations that are part of the California storage mandate) to provide grid services, system flexibility could be greatly enhanced. Doing so could significantly reduce curtailment and allow much greater penetration of variable generation resources in achieving a 50{\%} renewable portfolio standard. Overall, the work described in this paper points to the need to fully integrate distributed resources into grid system planning and operations to allow maximum use of the solar resource. },

abstract = {This addition to the ISOR series addresses the analytics of the operations of electric energy systems with increasing penetration of stochastic renewable production facilities, such as wind- and solar-based generation units.As stochastic renewable production units become ubiquitous throughout electric energy systems, an increasing level of flexible backup provided by non-stochastic units and other system agents is needed if supply security and quality are to be maintained.Within the context above, this book provides up-to-date analytical tools to address challenging operational problems such as:• The modeling and forecasting of stochastic renewable power production. • The characterization of the impact of renewable production on market outcomes. • The clearing of electricity markets with high penetration of stochastic renewable units. • The development of mechanisms to counteract the variability and unpredictability of stochastic renewable units so that supply security is not at risk. • The trading of the electric energy produced by stochastic renewable producers. • The association of a number of electricity production facilities, stochastic and others, to increase their competitive edge in the electricity market. • The development of procedures to enable demand response and to facilitate the integration of stochastic renewable units.This book is written in a modular and tutorial manner and includes many illustrative examples to facilitate its comprehension. It is intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of electric energy systems, applied mathematics and economics. Practitioners in the electric energy sector will benefit as well from the concepts and techniques explained in this book.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Although the clinical aspects have been well described, little information is available regarding the emotional, social, and economic impact of rotavirus gastroenteritis on the family of a sick child. The objectives of this study were to: 1) assess the family impact of rotavirus gastroenteritis through qualitative interviews with parents; 2) compare the clinical severity of rotavirus-positive and negative gastroenteritis; 3) test a questionnaire asking parents to rank the importance of various factors associated with a case of rotavirus gastroenteritis. METHODS: The study enrolled parents and children (2-36 months of age) brought to one of the study sites (outpatient clinic or ER) if the child experienced {\textgreater} or = 3 watery or looser-than normal stools and/or forceful vomiting within any 24-hour period within the prior 3 days. The clinical severity of each child's illness was rated using a clinical scoring system and stool samples were tested for rotavirus antigen. Parents of rotavirus-positive children were invited to participate in focus group or individual interviews and subsequently completed a questionnaire regarding the impact of their child's illness. RESULTS: Of 62 enrolled children, 43 stool samples were collected and 63{\%} tested positive for rotavirus. Illness was more severe in children with rotavirus-positive compared to rotavirus-negative gastroenteritis (92{\%} vs. 37.5{\%} rated as moderate/severe). Seventeen parents of rotavirus-positive children participated in the interviews and completed the written questionnaire. Parents were frightened by the severity of vomiting and diarrhea associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis, and noted that family life was impacted in several ways including loss of sleep, missed work, and an inability to complete normal household tasks. They expressed frustration at the lack of a specific medication and the difficulty of treating the illness with oral rehydration solutions, but had a largely positive outlook concerning the prospect of a rotavirus vaccine. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of how rotavirus gastroenteritis impacts the family can help healthcare providers ease parental fears and advise them on the characteristics of this illness, practices to prevent infection, and the optimal care of an affected child.},

abstract = {We present and analyse the kinematics and orbits for a sample of 488 open clusters (OCs) in the Galaxy. The velocity ellipsoid for our present sample is derived as ($\sigma$U, $\sigma$V, $\sigma$W) = (28.7, 15.8, 11.0)kms-1 which represents a young thin-disc population. We also confirm that the velocity dispersions increase with the age of a cluster subsample. The orbits of OCs are calculated with three Galactic gravitational potential models. The errors of orbital parameters are also calculated considering the intrinsic variation of the orbital parameters and the effects of observational uncertainties. The observational uncertainties dominate the errors of derived orbital parameters. The vertical motions of clusters calculated using different Galactic disc models are rather different. The observed radial metallicity gradient of clusters is derived with a slope of b = -0.070 +/- 0.011dexkpc-1. The radial metallicity gradient of clusters based on their apogalactic distances is also derived with a slope of b = -0.082 +/- 0.014dexkpc-1. The distribution of derived orbital eccentricities for OCs is very similar to that derived for the field population of dwarfs and giants in the thin disc.},

abstract = {Electric power has become an essential part of daily life: we plug our electronic devices in, switch our lights on, and expect to have power. As the availability of power is usually taken for granted in modern societies, we mostly feel annoyed at its absence and perceive the importance of power during outages which have severe effects on the public order. Blackouts have had disastrous consequences for many countries and they continue to occur frequently. Such examples demonstrate the necessity for careful analysis and planning of power grids, to ultimately increase the reliability of power grids. The power grids have evolved due to economic, environmental and human-caused factors. In addition to the contingency analysis, nowadays, the operation and planning of power grids are facing many other challenges (such as demand growth, targeted attacks, cascading failures, and renewable energy integration). Thus, many questions arise, including: which buses (nodes) to connect with a new line (link)? What are the impacts of malicious attacks on power grids? How may an initial failure result in a cascade of failures? How to prepare for the integration of renewable energy? Answering such questions requires developing new concepts and tools for analysing and planning of power grids.Power grids are one of the largest and the most complex man-made systems on earth. The complex nature of power grids and its underlying structure make it possible to analyse power grids relying on network science. The applications of network science on power grids have shown the promising potential to capture the interdependencies between components and to understand the collective emergent behaviour of complex power grids. This thesis is motivated by the increasing need of reliable power grids and the merits of network science on the investigation of power grids. In this context, relying on network science, we model and analyse the power grid and its near-future challenges in terms of line removals/additions, malicious attacks, cascading failures, and renewable integration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noroviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis across all ages worldwide. These pathogens are generally understood to exhibit a wintertime seasonality, though a systematic assessment of seasonal patterns has not been conducted in the era of modern diagnostics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the Pubmed Medline database for articles published between 1997 and 2011 to identify and extract data from articles reporting on monthly counts of norovirus. We conducted a descriptive analysis to document seasonal patterns of norovirus disease, and we also constructed multivariate linear models to identify factors associated with the strength of norovirus seasonality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The searched identified 293 unique articles, yielding 38 case and 29 outbreak data series. Within these data series, 52.7{\%} of cases and 41.2{\%} of outbreaks occurred in winter months, and 78.9{\%} of cases and 71.0{\%} of outbreaks occurred in cool months. Both case and outbreak studies showed an earlier peak in season-year 2002-03, but not in season-year 2006-07, years when new genogroup II type 4 variants emerged. For outbreaks, norovirus season strength was positively associated with average rainfall in the wettest month, and inversely associated with crude birth rate in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. For cases, none of the covariates examined was associated with season strength. When case and outbreaks were combined, average rainfall in the wettest month was positively associated with season strength.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Norovirus is a wintertime phenomenon, at least in the temperate northern hemisphere where most data are available. Our results point to possible associations of season strength with rain in the wettest month and crude birth rate.},

abstract = {In this manuscript we continue the thread of [M. Chertkov, F. Pan, M. Stepanov, Predicting Failures in Power Grids: The Case of Static Overloads, IEEE Smart Grid 2011] and suggest a new algorithm discovering most probable extreme stochastic events in static power grids associated with intermittent generation of wind turbines. The algorithm becomes EXACT and EFFICIENT (polynomial) in the case of the proportional (or other low parametric) control of standard generation, and log-concave probability distribution of the renewable generation, assumed known from the wind forecast. We illustrate the algorithm's ability to discover problematic extreme events on the example of the IEEE RTS-96 model of transmission with additions of 10{\%};20{\%} and 30{\%} of renewable generation. We observe that the probability of failure may grow but it may also decrease with increase in renewable penetration, if the latter is sufficiently diversified and distributed.},

abstract = {Norovirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with raw shellfish consumption. In Australia there have been several reports of norovirus outbreaks associated with oysters despite the application of regulatory measures recommended by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. This study describes an outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis following the consumption of New South Wales oysters. In September 2007, OzFoodNet conducted a cohort study of a gastroenteritis outbreak amongst people that had dined at a Port Macquarie restaurant. Illness was strongly associated with oyster consumption, with all cases having eaten oysters from the same lease (RR undefined, p {\textless} 0.0001). Norovirus was detected in a faecal specimen. Although no pathogen was identified during the environmental investigation, the source oyster lease had been closed just prior to harvesting due to sewage contamination. Australian quality assurance programs do not routinely test oysters for viral contamination that pose a risk to human health. It is recommended that the feasibility of testing oysters for norovirus, particularly after known faecal contamination of oyster leases, be assessed.},

abstract = {In recent days almost every study concerning the analyses of power systems for market related purposes uses DC power flow. DC power flow is a simplification of a full power flow looking only at active power flows. Aspects as voltage support and reactive power management are not considered. However, such simplifications cannot always be justified and might sometimes be unrealistic. In this paper authors analyze the assumptions of DC power flow, and make an attempt at quantifying these using indexes. Among other, the paper answers the question of how low the X/R ratio of line parameters can be, and what is the maximal deviation from the perfect flat voltage which still allows DC power flow to be acceptably accurate.},

Fukushima and its adjacent prefectures were contaminated with fission products from the accident. Here, we show a geographical distribution of radioactive iodine, tellurium, and cesium in the surface soils of central-east Japan as determined by gamma-ray spectrometry. Especially in Fukushima prefecture, contaminated area spreads around Iitate and Naka-Dori for all the radionuclides we measured. Distributions of the radionuclides were affected by the physical state of each nuclide as well as geographical features. Considering meteorological conditions, it is concluded that the radioactive material transported on March 15 was the major contributor to contamination in Fukushima prefecture, whereas the radioactive material transported on March 21 was the major source in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Saitama, and Chiba prefectures and in Tokyo.},

It is attractive for accurate or approximate off-and on-line routine and contingency calculations for networks of any size, and can be implemented efficiently on computers with restrictive core-store capacities. The method is a development on other recent work employing the MW-$\Theta$/ MVAR-V decoupling principle, and its precise algorithmic form has been determined by extensive numerical studies. The paper gives details of the method's performance on a series of practical problems of up to 1080 buses. A solution to within 0.01 MW/MVAR maximum bus mismatches is normally obtained in 4 to 7 iterations, each iteration being equal in speed to 1½ Gauss-Seidel iterations or 1/5th of a Newton iteration. Correlations of general interest between the power-mismatch convergence criterion and actual solution accuracy are obtained.},

@article{Touchette2009,
abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A prospective study with Ninety-five respondents recruited based on inclusion/exclusion criteria for a duration of six months (April 2016-September 2106) at a local government hospital in the Philippines. A Self-administered standardized questionnaire was given to parents. Results: Acute gastroenteritis moderately affected the children's sleep. They were noted to become more clingy, irritable and sad. Parents themselves became severely worried. Their sleep, daily activities inside the home, level of energy, and social interactions were moderately affected. In addition, Acute Gastroenteritis also brought moderate stress to the parents. They became mildly upset, frustrated, guilty, embarrassed and helpless. Moreover, there was no significant association demonstrated between the demographic status of the parents and the negative impact on their physical, emotional and social interaction because of the children's gastroenteritis. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant association between the symptom severity of gastroenteritis with the child's functional and emotional symptoms. Conversely, Acute gastroenteritis did not show statistical significant association with the physical and emotional status of the parents. It significantly affected their social interaction with other family members, friends and extended family. Conclusion: Acute gastroenteritis affects the quality of life of both parents and children and poses a significant negative impact on their daily lives. Relevant measures such as proper counseling on sanitation and hygiene, nutrition and vaccination by healthcare practitioners are therefore imperative to prevent the disease occurrence.},

abstract = {In this book we attempt to develop the fundamental results of resistive network analysis, based upon a sound mathematical structure. The axioms upon which our development is based are Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, and Kirchhoff's Current Law. In order to state these axioms precisely, and use them in the development of our network analysis, an elaborate mathematical structure is introduced, involving concepts of graph theory, linear algebra, and one dimensional algebraic topology. The graph theory and one dimensional algebraic topology used are developed from first principles; the reader needs no background in these subjects. However, we do assume that the reader has some familiarity with elementary linear algebra. It is now stylish to teach elementary linear algebra at the sophomore college level, and we feel that the require­ ment that the reader should be familiar with elementary linear algebra is no more demanding than the usual requirement in most electrical engineering texts that the reader should be familiar with calculus. In this book, however, no calculus is needed. Although no formal training in circuit theory is needed for an understanding of the book, such experience would certainly help the reader by presenting him with familiar examples relevant to the mathematical abstractions introduced. It is our intention in this book to exhibit the effect of the topological properties of the network upon the branch voltages and branch currents, the objects of interest in network analysis.},

In a regular two-dimensional grid graph with cyclic boundary conditions, we find a power law decay for the change of power flow as a function of distance to the disturbance over a wide range of distances. The power exponent increases and saturates for large system sizes. By applying the same analysis to the German transmission grid topology, we show that also in real-world topologies a long-ranged response can be found.},

For estimating the small probability of large power spills, we use the splitting technique for rare-event simulations. An appropriate Importance Function for splitting is formulated such that it reduces the work-load of the probability estimator as compared to the conventional Crude Monte Carlo probability estimator. Simulation results show that the ramp constraints imposed on the charging/discharging rate of the storage device plays a pivotal role in mitigating large power spills. It is observed that by employing a new charging strategy for the storage device large power spills can be minimized further. There exists a trade-off between reducing the large power spills versus reducing the average power spills.},

abstract = {We present a new high-resolution global renewable energy atlas (REatlas) that can be used to calculate customised hourly time series of wind and solar PV power generation. In this paper, the atlas is applied to produce 32-year-long hourly model wind power time series for Denmark for each historical and future year between 1980 and 2035. These are calibrated and validated against real production data from the period 2000 to 2010. The high number of years allows us to discuss how the characteristics of Danish wind power generation varies between individual weather years. As an example, the annual energy production is found to vary by ±10{\%} from the average. Furthermore, we show how the production pattern change as small onshore turbines are gradually replaced by large onshore and offshore turbines. Finally, we compare our wind power time series for 2020 to corresponding data from a handful of Danish energy system models. The aim is to illustrate how current differences in model wind may result in significant differences in technical and economical model predictions. These include up to 15{\%} differences in installed capacity and 40{\%} differences in system reserve requirements.},

The paper first provides a general discussion of the approximations associated with using a dc model, with an emphasis on the impact these approximations will have on security constrained OPF (SCOPF) results and LMP values. Then, since the impact of the approximations can be quite system specific, the paper provides case studies using both a small 37 bus system and a somewhat larger 12,965 bus model of the Midwest U.S. transmission grid. Results are provided comparing both the accuracy and the computational requirements of the two models. The general conclusion is that while there is some loss of accuracy using the dc approximation, the results actually match fairly closely with the full ac solution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Their high incidence and importance in health care facilities result in a great impact on public health. Studies from around the world describing increasing prevalence have been difficult to compare because of differing nomenclatures for variants of the dominant genotype, GII.4. We studied the global patterns of GII.4 epidemiology in relation to its genetic diversity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data from NoV outbreaks with dates of onset from January 2001 through March 2007 were collected from 15 institutions on 5 continents. Partial genome sequences (n=775) were collected, allowing phylogenetic comparison of data from different countries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The 15 institutions reported 3098 GII.4 outbreaks, 62{\%} of all reported NoV outbreaks. Eight GII.4 variants were identified. Four had a global distribution--the 1996, 2002, 2004, and 2006b variants. The 2003Asia and 2006a variants caused epidemics, but they were geographically limited. Finally, the 2001 Japan and 2001 Henry variants were found across the world but at low frequencies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: NoV epidemics resulted from the global spread of GII.4 strains that evolved under the influence of population immunity. Lineages show notable (and currently unexplained) differences in geographic prevalence. Establishing a global NoV network by which data on strains with the potential to cause pandemics can be rapidly exchanged may lead to improved prevention and intervention strategies.},

abstract = {Passive linear networks are used in a wide variety of engineering applications, but the best studied are electrical circuits made of resistors, inductors and capacitors. We describe a category where a morphism is a circuit of this sort with marked input and output terminals. In this category, composition describes the process of attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. We construct a functor, dubbed the "black box functor", that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior. Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals. The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation. Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to the category of symplectic vector spaces and Lagrangian linear relations. We prove that this functor is a symmetric monoidal dagger functor between dagger compact categories. We assume the reader has some familiarity with category theory, but none with circuit theory or symplectic linear algebra.},

abstract = {How do local topological changes affect the global operation and stability of complex supply networks? Studying supply networks on various levels of abstraction, we demonstrate that and how adding new links may not only promote but also degrade stable operation of a network. Intriguingly, the resulting overloads may emerge remotely from where such a link is added, thus resulting in nonlocal failures. We link this counter-intuitive phenomenon to Braess' paradox originally discovered in traffic networks. We use elementary network topologies to explain its underlying mechanism for different types of supply networks and find that it generically occurs across these systems. As an important consequence, upgrading supply networks such as communication networks, biological supply networks or power grids requires particular care because even adding only single connections may destabilize normal network operation and induce disturbances remotely from the location of structural change and even global cascades of failures.},

abstract = {Jupiter and Saturn formed in a few million years (Haisch et al. 2001) from a gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration of their orbits on timescales of only {\~{}}100,000 years (Armitage 2007). Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration (Masset {\&} Snellgrove 2001, Morbidelli {\&} Crida 2007, Pierens {\&} Nelson 2008). The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later (Klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (Wetherill 1978, Hansen 2009) (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.},

abstract = {Globally, norovirus is associated with approximately one-fifth of all diarrhea cases, with similar prevalence in both children and adults, and is estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths annually in developing countries. Norovirus is an important pathogen in a number of high-priority domains: it is themost common cause of diarrheal episodes globally, the principal cause of foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States, a key health care–acquired infection, a common cause of travel-associated diarrhea, and a bane for deployedmilitary troops. Partly as a result of this ubiquity and burden across a range of different populations, identifying target groups and strategies for intervention has been challenging. And, on top of the breadth of this public health problem, there remain impor- tant gaps in scientific knowledge regarding norovirus, especially with respect to disease in low-income settings. Many pathogens can cause acute gastroenteritis. Historically, rotavirus was the most common cause of severe disease in young children globally. Now, vaccines are available for rotavirus and are universally recommended by theWorld Health Organization. In countries with effective rotavirus vaccination programs, disease due to that pathogen has decreased markedly, but norovirus persists and is now themost common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis requiring medical attention. However, the data supporting the precise role of norovirus in low- andmiddle-income settings are sparse.With vaccines in the pipeline, addressing these and other important knowledge gaps is increasingly pressing. We assembled an expert group to assess the evidence for the global burden of norovirus and to consider the prospects for norovirus vaccine development. The group assessed the evidence in the areas of burden of disease, epidemiology, diagnostics, disease attribution, acquired immunity, and innate susceptibility, and the group considered how to bring norovi- rus vaccines from their current state of development to a viable product that will benefit global health.},

@inproceedings{Mehta2016,
abstract = {The power flow equations are at the core of most of the computations for designing and operating electric power systems. The power flow equations are a system of multivariate nonlinear equations which relate the power injections and voltages in a power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to solve these equations, starting from Newton-based methods to homotopy continuation and other optimization-based methods. While many of these methods often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution due to its large basin of attraction, most of the methods struggle to find low-voltage solutions which play significant role in certain stability-related computations. While we do not claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods, this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in methods for solving power flow equations to the wider power systems community as well as bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization communities to the power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the traditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we focus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, Groebner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using semidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an upper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review the current status of research in this direction.},

In this paper the basic functionality of PyPSA is described, including the formulation of the full power flow equations and the multi-period optimisation of operation and investment with linear power flow equations. PyPSA is positioned in the existing free software landscape as a bridge between traditional power flow analysis tools for steady-state analysis and full multi-period energy system models. The functionality is demonstrated on two open datasets of the transmission system in Germany (based on SciGRID) and Europe (based on GridKit).},

It contains 6001 lines (alternating current lines at and above 220 kV voltage level and all high voltage direct current lines), 3657 substations, a new open database of conventional power plants, time series for electrical demand and variable renewable generator availability, and geographic potentials for the expansion of wind and solar power. The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability. The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. A further novelty of the dataset is the publication of the full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement of the individual parts. This paper focuses on the description of the network topology, the compilation of a European power plant database and a top-down load time-series regionalisation. It summarises the derivation of renewable wind and solar availability time-series from re-analysis weather datasets and the estimation of renewable capacity potentials restricted by land-use. Finally, validations of the dataset are presented, including a new methodology to compare geo-referenced network datasets to one another.},

abstract = {POWER GRID MODEL AND DC APPROXIMATION We model the power grid network as a connected weighted graph G with n nodes, modeling buses, and m edges, representing the transmission lines. We make use of the DC approximation, which is commonly used in high-voltage transmission system analysis [1-4]. Choosing an arbitrary but fixed orientation of the transmission lines, the network structure is described by the edge-vertex incidence matrix C ∈ R m×n defined as C ,i =      1 if = (i, j), −1 if = (j, i), 0 otherwise. Denote by $\beta$ = $\beta$ i,j = $\beta$ j,i {\textgreater} 0 the weight of edge = (i, j), corresponding to the susceptance of that transmission line. By convention, we set $\beta$ i,j = $\beta$ j,i = 0 if there is no transmission line between i and j. Denote by B the m × m diagonal matrix defined as B = diag($\beta$ 1 ,. .. , $\beta$ m). The network topology and weights are simultaneously encoded in the weighted Laplacian matrix of the graph G, defined as L = C BC or entry-wise as L i,j = −$\beta$ i,j if i = j, k =j $\beta$ i,k if i = j. All the rows of L sum up to zero and thus the matrix L is singular. The eigenvalue zero has multiplicity one (thanks to the assumption that the graph G is connected) and the corresponding eigenvector is 1. Denote by v 2 ,. .. , v n the remaining eigenvectors of L, which are orthogonal to 1 and thus have all zero sum. According to the DC approximation, the relation between any zero-sum vector of power injections p ∈ R n and the phase angles $\theta$ ∈ R n they induce in the network nodes can be written in matrix form as p = L$\theta$, Defining L + ∈ R n×n as the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of L, we can rewrite this as $\theta$ = L + p. (1) This latter identity is particularly useful in our context, since it holds for any vector of power injections p ∈ R n , even if it has no zero sum. Indeed, decomposing the vector p using the basis of eigenvectors 1, v 2 ,. .. , v n of L + one notices that the only component of p with non-zero sum belongs to the null space of L + (generated by the eigenvector 1). This mathematical fact corresponds to the assumption that the power grid has automatic redispatch/balancing mechanisms, in which the total power injection mismatch is distributed uniformly among all the nodes, thus ensuring that the total net power injection is always zero. Denote by J ∈ R n×n the matrix with all entries equal to one. Exploiting the eigenspace structure of L, L + can be calculated as L + = L + 1 n J −1 − 1 n J, In the literature, instead of L + it is commonly used another matrix ¯ L, calculated using the inverse of the (n − 1) × (n − 1) sub-matrix obtained from L by means of deleting the first row and first column. In our method we are implicitly choosing an average value of zero as a reference for the nodes voltage phase angles, while in the classical one the first node is used as reference by setting is phase angle equal to zero. We remark that these two procedure are equivalent if one is interested in the line power flows, as these latter depend only on the phase angle differences. However, the matrix ¯ L does not account for the distributed slack, which needs to added by post-multiplying by the matrix S = I − 1 n J ∈ R n×n. The real line power flowsˆfflowsˆflowsˆf are related with the phase angles $\theta$ via the linear relationˆfrelationˆrelationˆf = BC$\theta$. In view of Eq. (1), the line power flowˆfflowˆflowˆf can be written as a linear transformation of the power injections p, i.e. ˆ f = BCL + p. (2)},

@article{Lodder2005,
abstract = {Since virus concentrations in drinking waters are generally below the detection limit, the infectious risk from drinking water consumption requires assessment from the virus concentrations in source waters and removal efficiency of treatment processes. In this study, we estimated from reverse transcription-PCR on 10-fold serially diluted RNA that noroviruses, the most prevalent waterborne gastroenteritis agents, were present at 4 (0.2 to 38) to 4,900 (303 to 4.6 x 10(4)) PCR-detectable units (PDU) per liter of river water (ranges are given in parentheses). These virus concentrations are still high compared with 896 to 7,499 PDU/liter of treated sewage and 5,111 to 850,000 PDU/liter in raw sewage. Sequencing analyses designated human norovirus GGII.4 Lordsdale as the most prevalent strain in the sampling period 1998 to 1999 in both sewage and surface waters. Other GGII strains were also very abundant, indicating that the majority of the virus contamination was derived from urban sewage, although very divergent strains and one animal strain were also detected in the surface and sewage waters. Rotaviruses were also detected in two large rivers (the Maas and the Waal) at 57 to 5,386 PDU/liter. The high virus concentrations determined by PCR may in part be explained by the detection of virus RNA instead of infectious particles. Indeed, reoviruses and enteroviruses that can be cultured were present at much lower levels, of 0.3 to 1 and 2 to 10 PFU/liter, respectively. Assuming 1{\%} of the noroviruses and rotaviruses to be infectious, a much higher disease burden than for other viruses can be expected, not only because of the higher levels but also because of these viruses' higher infectivity and attack rates.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite accounting for approximately one fifth of all acute gastroenteritis illnesses, norovirus has received comparatively less attention than other infectious pathogens. With several candidate vaccines under development, characterizing the global economic burden of norovirus could help funders, policy makers, public health officials, and product developers determine how much attention and resources to allocate to advancing these technologies to prevent and control norovirus.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed a computational simulation model to estimate the economic burden of norovirus in every country/area (233 total) stratified by WHO region and globally, from the health system and societal perspectives. We considered direct costs of illness (e.g., clinic visits and hospitalization) and productivity losses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Globally, norovirus resulted in a total of {\$}4.2 billion (95{\%} UI: {\$}3.2-5.7 billion) in direct health system costs and {\$}60.3 billion (95{\%} UI: {\$}44.4-83.4 billion) in societal costs per year. Disease amongst children {\textless}5 years cost society {\$}39.8 billion, compared to {\$}20.4 billion for all other age groups combined. Costs per norovirus illness varied by both region and age and was highest among adults ≥55 years. Productivity losses represented 84-99{\%} of total costs varying by region. While low and middle income countries and high income countries had similar disease incidence (10,148 vs. 9,935 illness per 100,000 persons), high income countries generated 62{\%} of global health system costs. In sensitivity analysis, the probability of hospitalization had the largest impact on health system cost estimates ({\$}2.8 billion globally, assuming no hospitalization costs), while the probability of missing productive days had the largest impact on societal cost estimates ({\$}35.9 billion globally, with a 25{\%} probability of missing productive days).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The total economic burden is greatest in young children but the highest cost per illness is among older age groups in some regions. These large costs overwhelmingly are from productivity losses resulting from acute illness. Low, middle, and high income countries all have a considerable economic burden, suggesting that norovirus gastroenteritis is a truly global economic problem. Our findings can help identify which age group(s) and/or geographic regions may benefit the most from interventions.},

The dual formalism is based on a consideration of the flows around closed cycles in the network. After some exposition of the theory is presented, a new formula for the computation of line outage distribution factors is derived, which is not only computationally faster than existing methods, but also generalizes easily for multiple line outages and arbitrary changes to line series reactance. In addition, the dual formalism provides new physical insight for how the effects of line outages propagate through the network. For example, in a planar network a single-line outage can be shown to induce monotonically decreasing flow changes, which are mathematically equivalent to an electrostatic dipole field.},
