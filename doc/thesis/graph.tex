\section{Directed graphs}
When studying the flow of current in a network, it is useful to fix a direction for each line, relative to which the flow can be expressed.
Semantically, a \emph{positive} flow along an edge will mean a flow in the same direction as the edge, while a \emph{negative} flow describes a 'positive' flow in the opposite direction.\todo{When flow is complex-valued, there is no pos/neg.} The choice of line direction could be seen as arbitrary. \todo{It turns out that this concept is called a `Gain Graph` (wiki)}
\begin{definition}
A \emph{directed graph}\index{graph!directed} is a pair $(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{L})$ such that the set of \emph{nodes} $\mathcal{N}$ is finite, and the set of \emph{lines} $\mathcal{L}\subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}$ satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $(i,j) \in \mathcal{L}$, then $(j,i) \notin \mathcal{L}$. (\ie there are no 'loops' between two nodes.)
    \item For each $i \in \mathcal{N}$: $(i,i) \notin \mathcal{L}$. (\ie no node is directly connected to itself.)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Note that the second requirement follows from the first.

\section{Flow}
\towrite{intro}
For the remainder of this section, assume that $G=(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{L})$ is a directed graph, where the nodes are labelled $\mathcal{N}=\{1,2,\dots,n\}=\range{n}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

The $m = \# \mathcal{L}$ lines of the network are labelled $\mathcal{L}=\{\mathcal{L}_1,\mathcal{L}_2,\dots,\mathcal{L}_m\}$.

Suppose $\mathbb{K}$ is a field.

\begin{definition}
An \define{injection} is an element of $\mathbb{K}^n$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
A \define{flow} is an element of $\mathbb{K}^m$.
\end{definition}

\todo{semantics}

\towrite{When $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{F}_2$, a flow can be seen as a subset of the collection of lines $\mathcal{L}$}

\begin{definition}\label{def:inducedinjection}
An injection $\mat{p} \in \mathbb{K}^n$ is \emph{induced}\index{induced injection} by a flow $\mat{f} \in \mathbb{K}^m$ if:
\begin{gather}
    \mel{p}_i =
    \sum_{\mathcal{L}_k=(i,j) \in \mathcal{L}} f_k -
    \sum_{\mathcal{L}_k=(j,i) \in \mathcal{L}} f_k \label{eq:inducedflow}
\end{gather}
for each node $i \in \mathcal{N}$.
\end{definition}
Note that $\mat{p}$ is uniquely defined for every choice of $\mat{f}$, under the condition that $G$ has no \emph{isolated nodes}\index{isolated node}: nodes with no lines connecting them.\todo{not necessary} This allows us to define a function:
\begin{definition}
Suppose $G$ has no isolated nodes. We define the \define{Linear Power Flow} ($\LPF$) as the function
\begin{gather*}
    \LPF: \mathbb{K}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^n
\end{gather*}
which maps a flow $\mat{f} \in \mathbb{K}^m$ to the unique injection $\mat{p} \in \mathbb{K}^n$ that it induces.
\end{definition}

From (\ref{eq:inducedflow}), it follows that $\LPF$ is a linear map. In fact, when written in matrix form, we find a familiar result: the transposed edge-vertex incidence matrix of $G$!\todo{blub}
$$\LPF = \mat{C}^T$$

The fact that $\LPF$ is a linear map raises an interesting question: how can the image and kernel of $\LPF$ be interpreted in the context of digraph flows?
The reader is invited to revisit Example \todo{examples} to visualise these sets.

One can interpret the image of $\LPF$ as the set of injections that can be redistributed along the network. Because a flow only serves to redistribute injections from one node to another, nothing is lost or gained in the network. This imposes the condition that an injection vector must have \emph{zero sum}. Moreover, when $G$ is connected, \emph{all} zero sum injections can be induced by a flow.

The kernel can be interpreted as the set of all flows that result in zero injections. Besides the trivial case of zero flow, any constant flow along a closed loop induces zero injection. We will find that these \emph{loop flows} generate \emph{all} flows in the kernel of $\LPF$. 

When $G$ is a planar graph, loops around the faces of $G$ actually form a \emph{basis} for the kernel. In the more general case that $G$ is connected, but not necessarily planar, such a basis can also be constructed by fixing a \emph{spanning subtree} of $G$.

As an added bonus, applying the Rank-Nullity theorem to $\LPF$ when $G$ is planar provides us with an alternative proof of Euler's Formula.

These statements will be made more precise in the next sections, when we study the image and kernel of $\LPF$ in more detail.

\subsection{Image of $\LPF$}
\towrite{intro}
\begin{definition}
The function $\sigma : \mathbb{K}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ defined by
\begin{gather*}
    \sigma : \mat{p} \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^n \mel{p}_i
\end{gather*}
is the linear map from an injection vector $\mat{p}$ to the \define{net injection} of $\mat{p}$.
\end{definition}
The kernel of $\sigma$ is the set of zero-sum injections:
$$\ker \sigma = \left\{ \mat{p} \in \mathbb{K}^n \, \mid \, \sum_{i=1}^n \mel{p}_i = 0 \right\}.$$
When $G$ is connected, this is exactly the set of injections that can be induced by a flow on $G$:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:imageLPF}
Suppose that $G$ is connected. Then
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{gather}
    \Ima \LPF = \left\{ \mat{p} \in \mathbb{K}^n \, \mid \, \sum_{i=1}^n \mel{p}_i = 0 \right\} \cong \mathbb{K}^{n-1}
\end{empheq}
\end{theorem}

We will prove this equality by considering the two inclusions $\subseteq$ and $\supseteq$ separately. The first inclusion follows from the observation that $\LPF = \mat{C}^T$:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:imlpfsubsetkersigma}
Suppose that $G$ is connected. 
\begin{gather}
\Ima \LPF \subseteq \ker \sigma\label{eq:LPFfin}
\end{gather}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We write $\mat{e}^1, \dots, \mat{e}^m$ for the standard basis of $\mathbb{K}^m$.

Since $\LPF$ is linear, one only needs to verify that $\LPF(\mat{f}) \in \ker \sigma$ for each $\mat{f}=\mat{e}^k$ in the basis.
The vectors $\LPF(\mat{e}^1), \dots, \LPF(\mat{e}^m)$ are exactly the columns of the matrix $\LPF = \mat{C}^T$, which all have zero sum. 
\end{proof}

To prove the inclusion $\supseteq$ implied by Theorem \ref{thm:imageLPF}, we first consider the special case that $G$ is a \emph{tree}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:connectedtree}
Suppose that $G$ is a (connected) tree.
\begin{gather}
\Ima \LPF \supseteq \ker \sigma
\end{gather}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\todo{This proof could benefit from an illustration.}
$G$ is a tree, so $m=n-1$. Because $\mathbb{K}^m$ and $\ker \sigma$ both have dimension $n-1$, we only need to prove that $\LPF$ is injective: when $\LPF$ has nullity $0$, it must have rank $n-1$. 

If $n=1$, then the digraph consist of a single node, and no lines. It then follows from (\ref{eq:inducedflow}) that the only injection that can be induced is $\mat{p}=(0) \in \mathbb{K}^1$, so $\LPF$ can only be injective.\todo{A single-node graph is not connected?}

If $n>1$, we will use the fact that the statement holds for any tree with fewer than $n$ nodes. \emph{(Proof by induction.)}

Suppose that $f \in \mathbb{K}^{m}$, such that $\mat{p}=\LPF(\mat{f})=\mat{0}$. Because $G$ is a tree, we can\footnote{Write $\gr(i)$ for the number of lines connected to $i$. $G$ is connected, so $\gr(i)\geq1$ for each $i \in \mathcal{N}$. \emph{If no $i$ exists with $\gr(i)=1$}, then $\gr(i)\geq 2$ for each $i \in \mathcal{N}$, giving $\sum_{i = 1}^n \gr(i) \geq 2n$. On the other hand, each of the $n-1$ lines connects exactly two nodes, so $\sum_{i = 1}^n \gr(i) = 2(n-1) < 2n$, a contradiction.} pick a \emph{leaf} $i \in \mathcal{N}$, which has a unique line $\mathcal{L}_k$ connecting $i$ to some $j \in \mathcal{N}$. (We have either $\mathcal{L}_k = (i,j)$ or $\mathcal{L}_k=(j,i)$.)

Only one line is connected to $i$, so (\ref{eq:inducedflow}) gives: $\mel{p}_i = \pm \mel{f}_k$. (The sign depends on the orientation of $\mathcal{L}_k$.) We assumed $\mel{p}_i=0$, so we must have $f_k = 0$.

By removing node $i$ and line $\mathcal{L}_k$, we obtain a smaller tree, for which the statement already holds. The Linear Power Flow of this subtree is essentially the restriction of $\LPF$ to the set $\left\{\mat{f} \in \mathbb{K}^m \, \mid \, \mel{f}_k = 0\right\}$.\todo{Make this mapping explicit? The fact that $\mel{p}_i=0$ is required?} Because the restriction is injective, all other coefficients of $\mat{p}$ are also zero. This shows that $\LPF$ is injective, and the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:imageLPF}]
To prove $\Ima \LPF = \ker \sigma$, it remains to show that 
\begin{gather}
\Ima \LPF \supseteq \ker \sigma
\end{gather}
holds for \emph{any} connected $G$, not just for trees.

Since $G$ is connected, we can choose a minimum spanning subtree: choose $T \subseteq \range{m}$ with $\# T = n-1$ such that $G_T=(\mathcal{N}, \{\mathcal{L}_k\}_{k \in T})$ is such a connected subdigraph.

Define $F_T = \linspan \{\mat{e}^k\}_{k \in T} \subseteq \mathbb{K}^m$ as the subset of flows on $G$ that are zero outside of $G_T$. Because $F_T$ is a linear subspace of $\mathbb{K}^m$, we have
$$\Ima \LPF = \LPF (\mathbb{K}^m) \supseteq \LPF(F_T),$$
which reduces the problem to $\LPF(F_T) \supseteq \ker \sigma$, which follows from Lemma \ref{lem:connectedtree}.\todo{Is this clear enough?}

This shows that
\begin{gather*}
    \Ima \LPF = \ker \sigma.
\end{gather*}
Because $\sigma : \mathbb{K}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ is surjective, it has rank $1$. It therefore has nullity $n-1$, or equivalently, $\ker \sigma \cong \mathbb{K}^{n-1}$. 
\end{proof}









\subsection{Kernel of $\LPF$}

Again, assume that $G$ is connected. In Theorem \ref{thm:imageLPF}, we derived an explicit formulation for the image of $\LPF$, showing that $\nullity \LPF = n-1$. 

Concerning the kernel of $\LPF$, we already know that $\mat{0} \in \ker \LPF$, reflecting the fact that zero flow induces zero injection. In the special case that $G$ is a tree, this is the only such flow. In general, however, the kernel of $\LPF$ is much bigger.
\towrite{introduce loops}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:nullityLPF}
Suppose that $G$ is connected. The dimension of $\ker \LPF$ equals
\begin{gather*}
    \nullity \LPF = m - (n - 1).
\end{gather*}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the Rank-Nullity theorem, \todo{state}applied to Theorem \ref{thm:imageLPF}.
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}
If $G$ is a tree, then $\ker \LPF = \{\mat{0}\}$, and $\LPF$ is a bijection between $\mathbb{K}^m$ and $\ker \sigma$.
\end{corollary} 
\begin{proof}
Applying Proposition \ref{prop:nullityLPF} with $m = n-1$, we find that $\nullity \LPF = 0$, so that ${\ker \LPF = \{\mat{0}\}}$. Together with Theorem \ref{thm:imageLPF}, we find the result.
\end{proof}

\towrite{talk about loops, use an example graph}

Any flow along a \emph{closed loop} results in zero power injection. When interpreting a loop as an element $\mat{f}$ of $\mathbb{K}^m$, we must be careful to \emph{flip the sign of $\mel{f}_k$ if the line $\mathcal{L}_k$ is traversed in reverse.}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:loopflowkernel}
Suppose that $G$ is connected and that $(i_1, i_2, \dots, i_p)$ is a closed loop. Then the \define{loop flow} $\mat{f} \in \mathbb{K}^m$ defined by:
\begin{gather}
    \mel{f}_k = \begin{cases}
    \hphantom{-}1 & \text{if } (i_s\hphantom{_{+1}}, i_{s+1})=\mathcal{L}_k \text{ for any } 1 \leq s < p,\\
    -1 & \text{if } (i_{s+1}, i_s\hphantom{_{+1}})=\mathcal{L}_k \text{ for any } 1 \leq s < p,\\
    \hphantom{-}0 & \text{otherwise,}
    \end{cases}\label{eq:loopflowdef}
\end{gather}
for each line $\mathcal{L}_k$, is an element of the kernel of $\LPF$.\todo{this thm only works for Eulerian paths...}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We will verify that $\mat{p}=\LPF(\mat{f})$ is zero. 
Choose any $i \in \mathcal{N}$.

Because the loop is closed, there is an \emph{even} number (possibly zero) of lines with non-zero flow that connect to $i$. This means that the sums in (\ref{eq:inducedflow}) cancel each other (note the negative sign for reversed lines in (\ref{eq:loopflowdef})), resulting in $\mel{p}_i=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Because $\LPF$ is linear, multiplying a loop flow with a scalar $\gamma \in \mathbb{K}$, or adding two loop flows, creates a new flow that induces zero injection. (The result of addition is a flow, but in general not a \emph{loop} flow.)
\end{remark}

Now that we know the dimension of $\ker \LPF$, a natural next step is to look for a \emph{basis} that generates the kernel. Motivated by the previous theorem, we will look for a basis consisting of \emph{loop flows}.

When looking at the previous examples, a logical choice for this basis would be the set of all flows in \emph{loops surrounding the faces contained in the graph}. This approach, which only works for \emph{planar graphs}, will be discussed in the next section.

For now, we would like to find a basis of loop flows for the more general case that $G$ is connected, but not necessarily planar. We proceed as follows:

\begin{definition}

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The ???? constructed in Definition ??? is a basis for $\ker \LPF$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Because the number of fundamental loops equals the dimension of $\ker \LPF$, one only needs to prove that they are linearly indepent. Indeed, for each $k \in \range{m}\setminus T$??????, ??$^k$ is the only fundamental loop for which the $k$th element is non-zero. Therefore, ???$^k$ cannot be written as linear combination of the other fundamental loops.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Planar Graphs}

TODO In a planar, connected graph, we have:
